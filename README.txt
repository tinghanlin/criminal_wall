Okay there are two files in here - mainqt.py and basicstruct.py.

mainqt is what is supposed to be the final code. 
I can't get the gif to play in the background if text is overlaid on it
& the playing of mp4s at the end is being problematic. 

basicstruct is to show what the gifs should look like. 

Anyway - there are just 3 example slides now but the words can all be listed in 
once the text overlay issue is fixed. Likewise, we can put diff mp4 files in for the last pages
